# Effortless Passwords

## Description 

This goal of this project is to help people come up with randomly generated secure passwords with a few parameters to choose from. A series of pop-ups will guide the user with various prompts and allow the user to custimize their randomly generated passwords.  

This repository includes an [index.html](index.html), [script.js](script.js), [style.css](style.css), [MIT License](license), [gitignore](gitignore) and this [README.md](README.md). 

Here's what it looks like:

## Usage 

Using this [random password generator](https://timcs1274.github.io/EffortlessPasswords/) is quite easy. All one must do is click the red "Generate Password" button to initialize the series of prompts. The user will first be asked how many characters they would like the password to be-- in this case, the password must be a number between 8 and 128 characters long. Second, the user will be asked a series of questions which determine if they would like to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. If the user chooses none to every question, they will be notified that at least one category needs to be confirmed and the function restarts. Once the user correctly answers all of the prompts, their randomly generated password will display within the dotted box.

## Learning Points

As this was my first project focused on javascript, I learned many things. My biggest take-away was how important a clear pseudo-code plan of attack is. Having a well thought out plan increases productivity by allowing you to focus on specific parts of the code. Another learning point is using the math object to randomize processes.
